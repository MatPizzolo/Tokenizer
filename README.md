Tokenizer

I choose to use a BEP20 Token.

BEP20 is a token standard on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). It is an extension of the Ethereum ERC-20 token standard, and it defines a set of rules that all BEP20 tokens must follow. These rules include how tokens can be transferred, burned, and minted. It is designed to enable developers to create and deploy tokens on the BNB Smart Chain.

BEP20 tokens are very popular on BSC, and they are used for a variety of purposes, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming.

BEP20 and ERC20 are both token standards, but they are used on different blockchains. BEP20 is used on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), while ERC20 is used on Ethereum. Both standards define a set of rules that all tokens must follow, such as how to transfer, burn, and mint tokens.
